I've been burning, yes, I've been burning
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burning up since you left
I've been smoking, oh
More than twenty a day
Blame it on rebellion
Don't blame it on me
Wish I was younger
Back to the nineteenth of May
I had an open mind
Swore to never change
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself
That river ran dry
You reached the limit
I wasn't enough
It's like the fire replaced all the love
I've been burning, yes, I've been burning
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burning up since you left
Oh, have you ever called
I will burst straight back
Give you my forgiveness
And the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to
Yeah, I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again
Just for a day, oh
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself
That river ran dry
You reached the limit
I wasn't enough
And it's like the fire replaced all the love
I've been burning, yes, I've been burning
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burning up since you left
Yeah, I've been burning up since you left
Oh, I've been burning up since you left
